# Pair: Dana Klimova & Alexey Schegrikovich 

## Task: 
Implement image filtering:
- Convert to grayscale
- GaussianBlur
- Retinex
 
## Style: 
We have choosed **as equals** style for our pair.  
 
## Result: 
Done: 
 We implement image filtering (it helps us better recognize the image). 
Impression: 
 It was much easier to understand the algorithms together, because the one who is quicker to understand, helps to understand it to another.Together we did less mistakes and we shared knowledge between each other. 
  
## Failed to do: 
 We should convert the image to grayscale, but it did not work.
 
## Are you going to use pair programming for other tasks?
Yes, because pair programming enhance performance and work quality of each person.
