## Task: 
Implement image filtering:
- Convert to grayscale
- GaussianBlur
- Retinex
 
## Style: 
We have choosed **as equals** style for our pair.  
 
## Result: 
#### Done: 
 We implement image filtering (it helps us better recognize the image). 
#### Impression: 
 It was much easier to understand the algorithms together, because the one who is quicker to understand, helps to understand it to another.Together we did less mistakes and we shared knowledge between each other. 
  
## Failed to do: 
 We should convert the image to grayscale, but it did not work.
 
## Are you going to use pair programming for other tasks?
Yes, because pair programming enhance performance and work quality of each person.

## Task: 
Implement image filtering:
- Improve code quality(remove unnecessary modules, remove side effects from change store function).
- Create page for extended settings for our app.
- Redesign extension(change button color, made similar extension and page designs).
 
## Style: 
We have choosed **Expert-Novice** style for our pair because one of us didn't know all approaches of ReactJS and JavaScript technologies but would like to learn it.  
 
## Result: 
#### Done:
We improved code quality(remove unnecessary modules, remove side effects from change store function), create page for extended settings for our app,
redesigned extension(change button color, made similar extension and page designs).
#### Impression:
Together we did less mistakes and we shared knowledge between each other.
  
## Failed to do: 
We failed to add button to the context menu and add image to settings page. Sometimes we distracted and one of us done his
own tasks.
 
## Are you going to use pair programming for other tasks?
Yes, we are, because it helps to learn novice faster (sometimes novice can teach something teacher) and makes better communication in team.

## Task: 
Improve image filtering:
- Convert to grayscale(pair Dana and Alexey didn't implement it)
- Before and after retinex perform discrete cosine transform
 
## Style: 
We have choosed **remote** style for our pair.  
 
## Result: 
#### Done: 
 We converted to grayscale and added discrete cosine transform before retinex and added inverse discrete cosine transform (it improve image filtering). 
#### Impression: 
 With other mate we found mistake faster, because we didn't have lost sharpness(не были "замылены глаза"). It was much easier to understand the algorithms together, because the one who is quicker to understand, helps to understand it to another.Together we did less mistakes and we shared knowledge between each other. 
  
## Failed to do: 
 We implement all tasks.
 
## Are you going to use pair programming for other tasks?
Yes, because pair programming enhance performance and work quality of each person.

## Task: 
Implement image filtering:
- Improve text detecting quality.
- Create interface for module-server interaction.
- Fix server bug with incorrect file opening on different operating systems.
 
## Style: 
We have choosed **Driver-Navigator** style for our pair.  
 
## Result:
#### Done:
We improved text detecting quality and created interface for module-server interaction.
#### Impression:
One from pair implemented architecture modules that another teammate designed. And role rotation provides better understanding of project structure and improves team spirit.
  
## Failed to do: 
We failed to fix server bug with incorrect file opening on different operating systems.
 
## Are you going to use pair programming for other tasks?
Yes, we are, because it's useful for our project and we see advantages of pair programming and enjoy by this process.
